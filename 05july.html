 <h1 id="about"><u>About</u></h1>
 <p>The film begins with a serial killer setting ablaze a lifeless body on a desolate street. As the murders continue, the death toll reaches 6, and ACP Ranjith Kumar is initially assigned to the case. However, after Ranjith gets into a coma due to a road accident, the case is handed over to ACP Aravindan, a brilliant and resolute officer, who had recently apprehended a finance robbery team led by Dheeran. Aravindan, along with Sub-inspector Manoharan, a cardiac patient and a single father, starts investigating the serial killings. Meanwhile, Sanjana, who had mistakenly met Aravindan thinking he was her prospective groom, falls in love with him, but Aravindan doesn't reciprocate her feelings. Aravindan discovers a crucial piece of evidence - an ankle-surgery plate in one of the victims, which helps them shortlist 7 individuals based on age. One of the suspects is Sudhakar, who has a history of ankle surgery. Next, Aravindan meets Meera, the twin sister of one of the victims. Meera's connection to Twin Birds school, where a similar photograph is found in Sudhakar's house, hints at a deeper connection between the suspects and victims.
